### About {.test}

<p style="text-align: justify;">

I am University Teacher in Statistics at the [School of Mathematics](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/people/a-z?person=1035), at the University of Edinburgh, and a part-time remote lecturer at Istinye University. In November 2023, I got the fellowship accreditation of Higher Education Academics in UK (FHEA). Previously, I held two postdoc positions at Padova University (2021) and KU Leuven (2020), after completing my PhD at Middle East Technical University in 2018.

Outside of university teaching, I am a **co-organiser** of Technology Enhanced Mathematical Sciences Education (TEMSE) seminars in School of Math, Generative AI TEMSE co-lead, **EdinbR community** and **RSS Edinburgh** local group member.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

I'm looking to collaborate on copulas and its applications, statistical methods for insurance and environment. I have a certain level of R skills and novice learner for Python programming. I am ambitious about improving my statistical learning skills by leading/organizing/being a part of training workshops. Recently, I am interested in Gen-AI tools and their impacts on teaching and learning.
