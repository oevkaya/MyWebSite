In November 2023, I got the fellowship accreditation of Higher Education Academics in UK (FHEA). Previously, I held two postdoc positions at Padova University (2021) and KU Leuven (2020), after completing my PhD at Middle East Technical University in 2018.\nOutside of university teaching, I am a co-organiser of Technology Enhanced Mathematical Sciences Education (TEMSE) seminars in School of Math, Generative AI TEMSE co-lead, EdinbR community and RSS Edinburgh local group member.\n\n\nI’m looking to collaborate on copulas and its applications, statistical methods for insurance and environment. I have a certain level of R skills and novice learner for Python programming. I am ambitious about improving my statistical learning skills by leading/organizing/being a part of training workshops. Recently, I am interested in Gen-AI tools and their impacts on teaching and learning.\n\n\n\n\nMain Research Interests\n\n\nCopulas and Its Applications,\nMixture of Vine Copulas,\nDrought Studies,\nStatistical Methods in Finance and Insurance,\nParameter Estimation and Model Selection\nGenerative AI applications\nStatistical Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nPhD in Statistics, Middle East Technical University (Turkey), 2012-2018\nMSc in Actuarial Science, Middle East Technical University (Turkey), 2009-2012\nBSc in Mathematics, Middle East Technical University (Turkey), 2004-09"
